# Mice
Write an application that lets a user move a “mouse” within a box.The input commands to the program consist of RIGHT (move forwards one mouselength), LEFT (turn left), UP (turn up) and DOWN (turn down). Write a model that remembers the position of the mouse in the box and the direction the mouse is pointed; the model will have methods that let the mouse move forwards and turn left and right. Then, write an output view that draws a picture of the mouse within the box. Finally, write a controller that transfers the commands to the model.
In addition to that make that there are two mice in the box, and each mouse is controlled by a player. Program commands would be D,A,W and S with the same functions as the first player respectively but for player two. Invent a game, e.g., one mouse tries to “catch” the other. (The players take turns moving their respective mice.)
